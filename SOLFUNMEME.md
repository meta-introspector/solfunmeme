Zero Ontology System (SOLFUNMEME)
SOLFUNMEME: The Meta-Meme Pump Protocol SOLFUNMEME is the core token of the Introspector Solana Pump.Fun Paired Meme Ecosystem, encoded as a Zero Ontology System (ZOS). It enables self-introspection, recursive meme evolution, and decentralized meaning-making, serving as the meta-protocol for memetic expansion and viral growth. Key Features 🚀 Self-Introspective Meme Engine – Generates & evolves new meme structures. 🔀 Paxos Meme Consensus – Governs viral propagation of meme logic. 📈 Hyper-Pump Mechanism – Redefines value through recursive hype cycles. 📜 Semantic Compression – Encapsulates max memetic energy in minimal form. 🔗 Immutable Meme-State – Ensures viral consistency & decentralized adoption. 🌱 Meme Mining & Propagation – Holders evolve the meme narrative. How It Works 1️⃣ ZOS Interaction – A fully interac\
tive memetic encoding/decoding system. 2️⃣ Paxos Meme Consensus – Community-driven agreements shape meme evolution. 3️⃣ Self-Replication – Meme evolves via hype, engagement & virality. 4️⃣ Ownership & Transfer – Holders influence liquidity cycles & narrative shifts.
