# CRQ-001: Nix Package Indexing and Reporting

## Title
Nix Package Indexing and Dependency Graph Reporting

## Description
This Change Request outlines the process for indexing all Nix packages within the project's flake, analyzing their dependency graphs, and generating a comprehensive report. The primary tool for this task will be `nixtract`, executed within a dedicated Gemini CLI session.

## Motivation
Understanding the project's Nix package landscape and its interdependencies is crucial for:
*   **Dependency Management**: Identifying and managing direct and transitive dependencies.
*   **Optimization**: Pinpointing areas for potential optimization in the Nix build process.
*   **Maintainability**: Improving the clarity and maintainability of the Nix flake structure.
*   **Impact Analysis**: Assessing the impact of changes to core Nix packages.
*   **Documentation**: Providing a clear overview of the project's Nix environment.

## Proposed Changes
1.  **Launch Gemini CLI Session**: Utilize the `launch_crq_session.sh` script to initiate a Gemini CLI session within the `vendor/nix/nixtract` submodule's context.
2.  **Execute `nixtract`**: Within the Gemini CLI session, execute the `nixtract` tool to extract derivation graphs from the project's root flake.
3.  **Save Output**: Direct the output of `nixtract` to `~/pick-up-nix2/index/file_nix.txt`.
4.  **Analyze and Report**: Analyze the generated `file_nix.txt` to understand package graphs and dependencies. Generate a human-readable report summarizing the findings.

## Impact
*   **Improved Visibility**: A clear understanding of Nix package dependencies.
*   **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Better-informed decisions regarding Nix package updates and refactoring.
*   **Centralized Documentation**: A dedicated report detailing the Nix environment.

## Verification
*   Confirm the existence and content of `~/pick-up-nix2/index/file_nix.txt`.
*   Verify that the generated report accurately reflects the Nix package dependencies and graphs.
