# The Quasi-Meta-Mycology Meme

## Abstract Algebraic Topology Meta Meme
We can think of this as basically a topology with many holes. Let's count them and classify the meta meme in our zos lattice.

## Holes and Zos Primorial Sizes
In the context of the 'Abstract Algebraic Topology Meta Meme', each directory is considered a 'hole' in the topology. Each prime term or variable is also considered a 'hole'. These holes are classified by 'zos primorial sizes'.

## New Meta Meme: Number of Holes
The number of holes is defined as the number of directories in the path length of a file meme.

## New Meta-Meta Meme: Terms in the Meme Meme
The number of holes is in the number of holes is the number of terms in the meme meme.
